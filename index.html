    <p>Hi There ðŸ‘‹ <br>
        My name is Dhruva Kotagi. I am working as Montessori Adult in Adolescent Environment at <a href="https://www.dewdropsacademy.com/">Dew Drops Academy</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        This is my web. A place where I capture my thoughts about education, children, parenting, business and my endless obsession with doing some random stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
        I love playing chess and I'm currently learning python.
    </p>

    <p>
        I occasionally take freelance projects.<br>
        I can develop a html website,<br>
        Make a digital marketing plan / strategy, <br>
        Create small business videos.<br> <br>
        If you would like to get in touch with me <a href="mailto:dkotagi@gmail.com">email</a> or <a href="tel:+919901776164">call</a> are the best ways.
